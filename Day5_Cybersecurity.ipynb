Nicknamed Tabby\\u2019s star, the celestial object features an odd dimming pattern. While some early potential explanations included comets, distortion, and space debris, none have provided a completely satisfactory solution. Astronomers Launch Search for Extraterrestrials in Potential 'Alien Megastructure' \\nThe more fanciful answer is that KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, an alien megastructure built by an advanced civilization to harness the sun\\u2019s energy. The Breakthrough Listen initiative, founded by Russian tycoon Yuri Milner, plans to spend over $100 million to investigate the star over the next ten years. \\n\\\"The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it\\u2019s the largest, most sensitive telescope that\\u2019s capable of looking at Tabby\\u2019s Star given its position in the sky,\\\" Breakthrough Listen co-director Andrew Siemion said in a statement, according to Space.com . \\n\\\"We\\u2019ve deployed a fantastic new SETI instrument that connects to that telescope, that can look at many gigahertz of bandwidth simultaneously and many, many billions of different radio channels all at the same time so we can explore the radio spectrum very, very quickly.\\\" \\nThe telescope\\u2019s observations began Wednesday night, and will continue for eight hours each night, for three nights over the next two-month period. \\nOther organizations have launched independent investigations into Tabby\\u2019s Star, including a Kickstarter campaign launched by the Yale astronomer Tabby Boyajian, who penned an initial study into the strange celestial object. Having raised over $100,000, that project plans to spend a year analyzing the star\\u2019s luminosity with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. NASA Earth-Like, Water-Rich Planets Could Be Common to Red Dwarfs \\nAs to whether new observations will uncover aliens, most scientists remain skeptical. \\\"I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s very likely \\u2013 a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that \\u2013 but nevertheless, we\\u2019re going to check it out,\\\" Dan Werthimer, chief scientists at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement. \\n\\\"But I think that ET, if it\\u2019s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It\\u2019ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident\\u2026that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, 'Hey, that\\u2019s a civilization.'\\\" \\nOf course, even if the Dyson sphere theory turns out to be true, that does not necessarily indicate life. Given the distance of the star, it will have taken 1,500 years for its light to reach Earth, meaning that we can only observe the star as it was 1,500 years ago. \\nThe civilization could be long gone. ...\",\n          \"AUSTRIA: Freedom Party leader calls Chancellor Angela Merkel the \\u201cmost dangerous woman in Europe\\u201d Heinz-Christian Strache (right), chairman of the anti-Islamization Freedom Party roasted the German Chancellor for allowing an unlimited amount of Muslim illegal aliens which he claims has left Europe on the verge of civil war. Talking to supporters, Strache argued \\u201cthe uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system\\u2026 makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.\\u201d Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party\\u2019s presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party\\u2019s presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, \\u201cwill be there for all Austrians\\u201d in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old\\u2019s recent election posters carry the phrase \\u201cso help me God\\u201d \\u2013 a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. \\u201cVienna must not become Istanbul\\u201d He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: \\u201cGod cannot be instrumentalised for one\\u2019s own intentions or for political purposes. \\u201cWe consider that mentioning God\\u2026 to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general.\\u201d The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came \\u201cdirectly from the heart\\u201d and \\u201cis strongly anchored in Christian and Western values\\u201d which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen\\u2019s left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered. The initial re-run of the election was due to take place in October but has been pushed back to December after defects were found in the postal vote envelopes.\",\n          \"1 / 2 \\nLe r\\u00eave s\\u2019av\\u00e9ra amer : il lui fallut vivre dans des pr\\u00e9fabriqu\\u00e9s de chantier, ce qui ne la dissuada pas. \\u00ab Je trouvais \\u00e7a marrant.

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.\\u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday.\",\n          \"Military Coup Attempt in Turkey ( 352 ) 0 10 0 0 A major reshuffle occurred to the police body in Turkey, where police chiefs in 61 Turkish provinces were either substituted or moved to other positions, local media reported, citing a government decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday. \\nMOSCOW (Sputnik) \\u2014 According to the Turkish Daily Sabah newspaper, 37 police chiefs were assigned for the first time to provincial police chief positions while 24 provincial police chiefs were reassigned to other provinces. \\nMeanwhile, two department heads in the General Directorate of Security were also reassigned to different positions and 34 provincial police chiefs were assigned to ministerial positions in Ankara, the daily added. \\nOn July 15, a military coup attempt took place in Turkey .

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen.

Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. \\nTownsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are \\u201cgoing to take this in steps,\\u201d and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. \\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only \\u201clocal forces\\u201d involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. \\nTurkey\\u2019s military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it.

Fire units are headed to the scene, according to McAdory Fire Station #2. Alagasco has stated that the fire is from a petroleum line. According to the Shelby County Sheriff\\u2019s office, the blast was on the Colonial Line, with 8-9 people injured. \\nFor those curious about the pipeline, the EIA has a great primer found here. \\nThe Sheriff adds that the blast happened during crew work. \\nThe explosion took place near 334 Highway 13.

I\\u2019m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder.\\n\\n\\u201cI was told that I am on the Kremlin\\u2019s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.\\u201d The Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.\\n\\nHe was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his \\u201cactive participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nPresident Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.\\n\\nRussia is hoping for a \\u201cnew understanding\\u201d and \\u201crestored Russian-American relations\\u201d according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be \\u201cencouraged\\u201d by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.\\n\\nAccording to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists\\u2019 destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.\\n\\u201cThe American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change. \\nYour News Wire \\nSOURCE  \",\n          \"Despite the establishment media\\u2019s hopes and repeated claims that it could never happen, Donald Trump is the president-elect of the United States of America. Now liberal pundits are scrambling to explain how the hell it happened. Isn\\u2019t this country changing demographically? Didn\\u2019t Donald Trump disqualify himself with his racist and sexist statements? What about the nuclear codes? \\nWell, Donald Trump had one thing in his favor: he ran against one of the most unpopular and despised presidential candidates in American history, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Combine the electorate\\u2019s Clinton antipathy with a risky but targeted strategy to flip the Rust Belt and it\\u2019s not so hard to understand why Donald Trump, a man with no experience in government, will be sitting in the oval office come late January.\\nThe usual suspects have had no luck in crafting a convincing narrative that doesn\\u2019t make them look like idiots. Joan Walsh of The Nation, a shameless hack for Hillary, wrote a sardonic piece wherein she played the victim and defended Clinton\\u2019s candidacy, saying, \\u201cshe had more of a message than her lefty haters give her credit for.\\u201d\\nActually, no, not really. Clinton ran the definition of a negative campaign and what little of a progressive message she presented was copy and pasted from Senator Bernie Sanders\\u2019 campaign and extremely unconvincing given her neoliberal record. Clinton had trust issues from the beginning, which were only exacerbated by her extremely dishonest attacks on Sanders and equally dishonest revisionism of her own herstory. \\nJamelle Bouie, whose biggest claim to fame is saying Trump could not win, offers another equally moronic analysis of Trump voters, claiming anyone who voted for Trump is a racist and deserves no empathy. Yes, African-Americans, Asians, and non-white Hispanics voted for Trump, but according to Bouie they apparently hate themselves.\\nBouie is reliably wrong, so expect him to fail up in pundit world. But his blame the voter strategy parallels that of bourgeoisie feminists, who claim women who voted for Trump (or even just did not for Clinton) did so because they have \\u201cinternalized misogyny.\\u201d Jess McIntosh, the former communications director for the Clinton campaign, made that explicit claim in an interview with DNC-friendly MSNBC. \\nSo, to recap, anyone who did not vote for Hillary Clinton this cycle hates minorities and women (including minorities and women).\\nWell, allow me to retort. Hillary Clinton lost the election because she was a terrible candidate. Nobody likes or trusts her (yes, elections actually are popularity contests) and her neoliberal domestic policies and neoconservative foreign policies turned people off because they are genuinely bad. Clinton represented the establishment in a change election, something she was happy to do. She even openly courted Republicans hoping her \\u201ctemperament\\u201d talking point would make partisan Republicans vote for one of the most hated Democrats in history. It didn\\u2019t work.\\nClinton also refused to talk about class and only seriously brought up racism to label Trump supporters as racist \\u201cdeplorables\\u201d and \\u201cirredeemable.\\u201d Which, beyond excessively judgmental, was just stupid politics as many of those people live in the god damn Rust Belt. Way to ensure they voted Hillary! If Clinton is so smart, why is she so stupid? Riddle me that.\\nNow, thank the lord, we as a country are going to move on from the Clinton crime family. The Democratic Party needs a major overhaul, which it will have plenty of time to focus on as it is now out of power in the House, Senate, and White House. Great job, Team Hillary.\\nBut first, how about the Hillary Clinton supporters stop blaming everyone else for their terrible candidate? Democrats had a populist who did well in the Rust Belt, Clinton supporters did everything they could to destroy him.
