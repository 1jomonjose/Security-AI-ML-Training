Nicknamed Tabby\\u2019s star, the celestial object features an odd dimming pattern. While some early potential explanations included comets, distortion, and space debris, none have provided a completely satisfactory solution. Astronomers Launch Search for Extraterrestrials in Potential 'Alien Megastructure' \\nThe more fanciful answer is that KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, an alien megastructure built by an advanced civilization to harness the sun\\u2019s energy. The Breakthrough Listen initiative, founded by Russian tycoon Yuri Milner, plans to spend over $100 million to investigate the star over the next ten years. \\n\\\"The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it\\u2019s the largest, most sensitive telescope that\\u2019s capable of looking at Tabby\\u2019s Star given its position in the sky,\\\" Breakthrough Listen co-director Andrew Siemion said in a statement, according to Space.com . \\n\\\"We\\u2019ve deployed a fantastic new SETI instrument that connects to that telescope, that can look at many gigahertz of bandwidth simultaneously and many, many billions of different radio channels all at the same time so we can explore the radio spectrum very, very quickly.\\\" \\nThe telescope\\u2019s observations began Wednesday night, and will continue for eight hours each night, for three nights over the next two-month period. \\nOther organizations have launched independent investigations into Tabby\\u2019s Star, including a Kickstarter campaign launched by the Yale astronomer Tabby Boyajian, who penned an initial study into the strange celestial object. Having raised over $100,000, that project plans to spend a year analyzing the star\\u2019s luminosity with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. NASA Earth-Like, Water-Rich Planets Could Be Common to Red Dwarfs \\nAs to whether new observations will uncover aliens, most scientists remain skeptical. \\\"I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s very likely \\u2013 a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that \\u2013 but nevertheless, we\\u2019re going to check it out,\\\" Dan Werthimer, chief scientists at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement. \\n\\\"But I think that ET, if it\\u2019s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It\\u2019ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident\\u2026that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, 'Hey, that\\u2019s a civilization.'\\\" \\nOf course, even if the Dyson sphere theory turns out to be true, that does not necessarily indicate life. Given the distance of the star, it will have taken 1,500 years for its light to reach Earth, meaning that we can only observe the star as it was 1,500 years ago. \\nThe civilization could be long gone. ...\",\n          \"AUSTRIA: Freedom Party leader calls Chancellor Angela Merkel the \\u201cmost dangerous woman in Europe\\u201d Heinz-Christian Strache (right), chairman of the anti-Islamization Freedom Party roasted the German Chancellor for allowing an unlimited amount of Muslim illegal aliens which he claims has left Europe on the verge of civil war. Talking to supporters, Strache argued \\u201cthe uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system\\u2026 makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.\\u201d Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party\\u2019s presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party\\u2019s presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, \\u201cwill be there for all Austrians\\u201d in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old\\u2019s recent election posters carry the phrase \\u201cso help me God\\u201d \\u2013 a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. \\u201cVienna must not become Istanbul\\u201d He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: \\u201cGod cannot be instrumentalised for one\\u2019s own intentions or for political purposes. \\u201cWe consider that mentioning God\\u2026 to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general.\\u201d The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came \\u201cdirectly from the heart\\u201d and \\u201cis strongly anchored in Christian and Western values\\u201d which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen\\u2019s left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered. The initial re-run of the election was due to take place in October but has been pushed back to December after defects were found in the postal vote envelopes.\",\n          \"1 / 2 \\nLe r\\u00eave s\\u2019av\\u00e9ra amer : il lui fallut vivre dans des pr\\u00e9fabriqu\\u00e9s de chantier, ce qui ne la dissuada pas. \\u00ab Je trouvais \\u00e7a marrant.

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.\\u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday.\",\n          \"Military Coup Attempt in Turkey ( 352 ) 0 10 0 0 A major reshuffle occurred to the police body in Turkey, where police chiefs in 61 Turkish provinces were either substituted or moved to other positions, local media reported, citing a government decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday. \\nMOSCOW (Sputnik) \\u2014 According to the Turkish Daily Sabah newspaper, 37 police chiefs were assigned for the first time to provincial police chief positions while 24 provincial police chiefs were reassigned to other provinces. \\nMeanwhile, two department heads in the General Directorate of Security were also reassigned to different positions and 34 provincial police chiefs were assigned to ministerial positions in Ankara, the daily added. \\nOn July 15, a military coup attempt took place in Turkey .

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen.

Thirty-five percent of respondents said that the criticism of the West was hostile. Every fourth (25%) respondent believes that Western critics often criticize Russia for what they should be criticized themselves . Every fifth respondent (21%) said that Europe and the US have little understanding of life in Russia, \\\"but they still want to teach us.\\\"Critical remarks against Russia from Western countries are not worthy of attention, 30% of respondents said. The survey was conducted on October 21-24 among 1,600 people in 137 settlements of Russia.The majority of respondents 74% noted that the West wants to weaken and humiliate Russia by tightening sanctions against the country. According to 13 percent of respondent, the sanctions were imposed on Russia in an attempt to restore the geopolitical balance after Russia reunited with the Crimea. Another five percent believe that the sanctions policy of the West is aimed at ending the war in the east of Ukraine, while eight percent were undecided.At the same time, opinion polls conducted in the last days of October showed an increase in the ratings of the president and the government. The survey showed that the approval rating of the president rose from 78.7 to 81.8% from August to October. Positive assessments of the government's work increased from 53.6 to 58.3%.The Russian parliament's approval rating rose from 39.7% in September to 45.5%.Russia's armed forces have the support of 83.5% of the Russian population. The figure has doubled in ten years - from 44% in October 2006.

Native Americans have held few positions on the federal level\\u2014\\u201cone vice president, eight House representatives and two Senators,\\u201d according to the report. \\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re the first ones here, and we\\u2019re the last ones to have the opportunity to vote,\\u201d Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said of Native American communities. Native Americans across the country face barriers that systematically prevent them from voting , such as out-of-the-way polling booths, mail-in ballots sent only to those who have mailing addresses, refusal of state citizenship and bans from voting in state elections in states such as Arizona and New Mexico, which have significant Native populations. \\n\\u201cWe were the first peoples of this country, and yet we are not part of the governance of this country, and we think that\\u2019s a real miss,\\u201d Castro said. \\u201cIn order for us to get ourselves into elected office, we need people to elect us. What we\\u2019ve seen time and time again is that there are structural barriers that really dilute the Native vote or make it very difficult [to get] into elected office.\\u201d \\n\\u201cWe are having to deal with a colonial legacy that was intended to exclude us,\\u201d Chase Iron Eyes of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who is running for the House of Representatives in North Dakota, told BBC News . \\nSome Native American communities don\\u2019t see themselves as a significant part of the electorate. But while they make up less than 2 percent of the total U.S. population, they can make a difference in an election. \\n\\u201cWe are really working to change our cultural norms around our relationship with voting. \\u2026 We\\u2019re doing the hard work of culture shift to say that it is important that we participate,\\u201d Castro said. \\u201cThe Native vote does matter.\\u201d \\nThe Native vote has made a difference, the report says, in swing or battleground states with significant Native American populations that overwhelmingly lean Democratic. In 2012, Colorlines reports, Democratic candidates\\u2019 victories in some of the tightest Senate races in New Mexico, Montana and North Dakota are attributed to the Native vote . \\nPresidential hopefuls Dr. Jill Stein and Sen. Bernie Sanders understood the power of the Native vote, Castro said. Sanders brought on a Native American adviser, Tara Houska, and Stein joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\\u2019s protests . During the primaries, Secretary Clinton met with tribal leaders in Iowa, Washington, Arizona and California, according to BBC News. \\nAccording to the report, the Democratic Party has a formal infrastructure that is inclusive of Native Americans, including several Democratic Native American caucuses on the West Coast and a national director of Native American outreach. However, various Republican representatives told Castro that there is no comparable infrastructure in the GOP. \\nThe Dakota Access pipeline protest has helped bring Native American issues to the forefront, Castro said. \\n\\u201cI think the Dakota Access pipeline has really galvanized the Native American community across the country and even internationally,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAt Standing Rock, there\\u2019s been a lot of work to do canvassing and [engaging] voters as part of a strategy to make sure people that are in elected office understand the issues and the experiences of Native American people.\\u201d \\nThough the numbers this year are promising, with a record of eight Native American candidates running for Congress and more than 90 running for state legislatures, there needs to be \\u201cpathways\\u201d in place for future Native American politicians to make their way on to the ballot, the report argues. One way Native politicians can have equal access to government offices is for accurate data on Native Americans to be available so they could use the information to design voter turnout strategies. Currently, in California, there is data on numerous minority groups, but not Native American voters. \\nThere has been some recent success in bringing out the Native vote. Since its launch three months ago, Native Vote has registered 1,000 Native American voters in California, Castro said, calling this a necessary and robust Native American voter engagement campaign. Your #NativeVote makes a difference, and together, Indian Country's voices count! #RestoreTheVRA \\u2014 Native Vote (@nativevote) Oct. 20, 2016 \\nIn 2017, ANPL will launch pilot projects in Montana and New Mexico that will \\u201cbuild a pathway for Native American elected officials\\u201d by teaching children the importance of civic engagement and providing training for potential campaign managers and team members. Portland and Los Angeles will also host pilot projects on a local level, since more than 70 percent of Native Americans live away from reservations, in cities and suburbs. \\n\\u201cWe thought it was important to start looking at municipal races, to look at school boards, water boards, looking at city planning commissions, and really building infrastructure in municipals for elected and appointed positions to make sure our voices are heard at the local level,\\u201d Castro said. \\n\\u201cI think as Native Americans we are taking our rightful place as part of the fabric of leadership in this country. I think that we\\u2019re going to see good things if we\\u2019re able to see a more reflective democracy that\\u2019s inclusive of Native American peoples [and] of all of the diversity that exists in this country that we don\\u2019t see in these positions of power and decision-making.\\u201d \\nCastro is hopeful that Sen. Jon Tester\\u2019s (D-MT) proposed bill, the 2015 Native American Voting Rights Act , will pass next year and \\u201cright the wrongs\\u201d to protect Native American access to the polls. \\n\\u201cWe have a lot of work to do to make sure that people see themselves in these elections,\\u201d she said.

This is the complete release of formerly secret, official and governmental information through the public media. We have heard about the numerous possibilities of the truth of past events which exists behind closed doors\\u2014locked away in secret files protectively stamped with the word \\u201cClassified.\\u201d We know that to a very large extent, we as the common public know very little about the truth behind roughly a century of government and corporate secrecy on matters of high technology, ET life, and the heinous crimes committed for the sake of maintaining this secrecy. The subjects within the topic of disclosure are extremely dense and weighty to consider. One could spend hours digesting just one of these topics, which are commonly considered fringe in today\\u2019s society. However, we are here to discuss a different and yet parallel subject. This is the subject of individual choice, or more specifically, the choice to know . In order to see Disclosure, we must make the choice to be aware and have the courage to face the possibilities behind the truth which the disclosure will bring to light. Many of these truths will be unconventional, considering the fact that secrecy has defined convention for the past century. This does not mean that we should abandon our responsibility of thorough research and verification. It simply means that from vigorous research and diligent scrutiny, we must have the courage to face the information we encounter. \\nConscious Life Expo \\u2013 David Wilcock \\u2013 Page 1 \\u2013 New Intel, The Human Evolutionary Leap, Sacred Geometry, Illuminati Secrets, and More This article is dedicated to examining the concept of the partial disclosure , or the hindrance of the Disclosure process for the sake of a few financial interests. It is my hope that this article will help each and every one of us to discern and to face the truth the moment it is revealed. The Balance of Power There is one main reason for the need for a full-disclosure event to revolutionize the various societies of this planet. This Full Disclosure is to end the entirety of the secrecy for the sake of respect for the equality of all people. This disclosure is an acknowledgment to our right to know about all that affects our daily lives and represents the balancing of power among all people around the globe. With this balance in mind, it is important for us to know what power truly is. When we speak of power , many ideas may come to mind. Some of us may believe this word refers to one\\u2019s ability to control others. Others may think of it as a matter of economic influence, and there are those who simply think of power as one\\u2019s own ability to make their own choices. The truth is that all of these are valid definitions. To clarify, let\\u2019s check the definition from Merriam-Webster for the word \\u201cpower.\\u201d : the ability or right to control people or things : political control of a country or area : a person or organization that has a lot of control and influence over other people or organizations If we consider these definitions of this word, we may notice something. Aside from the definitions which refer to mathematical applications, there seems to be no reference to human equality of any kind. It seems that in this official definition, the modern English language has all but completely done away with the fact that true power comes from the individual, and in essence, is equally distributed among all people. Let\\u2019s consider a few examples. \\nAmerican Mind Control: The Cost of Secrecy Part 1 \\u2013 Examining the Effects of Secrecy, Propaganda, and Organized, White-Collar Crime \\nMost of us are familiar with the concept of governmental monarchy. This is of course, the form of centralized government in which a single figurehead holds complete control over an area, province, or country. Yet even though this one individual supposedly holds all of this power, they would have no control at all unless everyone else agreed to allow them that control. Jacques Louis David \\u2013 The-Coronation of Napoleon In every ancient monarchical government structure, no single ruling figure could have held any such authority without the entire kingdom agreeing that they should. Generally speaking, if the people do not decide to follow, no authority can lead anyone in any way. A king or queen has dozens of servants, maids, butlers, cooks, groundskeepers and gardeners, craftsmen, and guards. They have advisers and clergymen who direct their political decisions, and armies of thousands who obey their every whim. However, not a single order of this monarchic figure would ever mean anything if the people chose not to follow them. \\nFull Disclosure and Ascension \\u2013 Commentary of the Latest Article from David Wilcock In the common social interaction in which equality of power is acknowledged, there is no hierarchy. When one person starts giving orders to another, they probably won\\u2019t get much from the person (except maybe the finger and/or some choice words). Now take these same two people\\u2014one giving the order and the other receiving that order\\u2014and place beside these two, five other people who are following the orders. Due to this situation, the compulsion to obey is somewhat increased. Now add in 10, 20, 50, or even an entire country of people doing as they are mandated to do by some unseen authority, and the compulsion to obey is compounded. Add in the ability of the authority to order punishment upon those who disobey, and this control is solidified. We as human beings have the conditioning to conform to whatever social situation we find ourselves in. This is not to say that this tendency cannot be overcome. It is merely to say that we are raised to conform to the collective of society. This social conformity may have a few positive aspects up to a certain point. However for those who appreciate independent thought and the freedom to choose for themselves, this pull to conform can be somewhat of an annoyance. The above example of this social tendency to conform demonstrates the psychological concept of social conditioning , or what many in modern days refer to as the sheep effect . \\nPsych Central \\u2013 \\u201cHerd\\u201d Mentality Explained \\nThe sheep effect could be described as the tendency of a person to automatically do whatever those around them are doing. This could simply be initiated by one person repeating an action, or it could be an entire group practicing . Eventually, you may have a large group of people doing the same thing over and over again without knowing why. The following clip comes from a show which airs on the National Geographic channel called Brain Games , and demonstrates a prime example of the sheep effect in action. Brain games \\u2013 Social conformity What Lies Beyond the Haze of Social Conditioning? So as we can see, it seems fairly easy to subtly coerce a suggestible person into following a social norm even though they have no logical reason for doing so. To be fair, this woman most likely reasoned to herself that the bell had something to do with being called for her appointment. What is interesting to see is that she never actually asked about why the group kept standing. There seems to have simply been the rationalization, immediately followed by conformity. This tendency of social conformity is a pervasive phenomenon which seems to grip the entirety of developed societies around the world. In fact, this conformity may be the one of the main reasons why large civilizations have developed in the way that they have. It is very likely that this coercion to conform has been used to create various facets of society, and to build that which has been built. However, as we may have seen, modern society doesn\\u2019t serve all people equally. Instead the supposedly civilized world appears to be designed to use the individual for their entire lifetime. When society has taken the best years of life of the individual, it discards them while at the same time, it grooms their children to be used in the exact same way. \\nWisdom Teachings with David Wilcock \\u2013 \\u201cThe Cabal\\u2019s Downward Spiral\\u201d \\u2013 Assessing the Final Days of a Crumbling Cabal, and a Prelude to Breakthrough This grossly exploitative societal structure appears to have been designed by those who benefit from it most. These benefactors don\\u2019t work. They don\\u2019t contribute, but in many ways they use and enjoy the spoils of everything that we the people work for. Due to their elitist mentality and upbringing, these manipulators have, in a sense, domesticated the rest of humanity to work as their own servants, and have collectively assumed the position of the monarch of ancient times\\u2014creating an oligarchy. So what\\u2019s the significance of these discoveries, and what do they have to do with to partial disclosure? The Nature of Unbalanced Power The bottom line is that a partial disclosure would serve as a prime opportunity for more elitists to assume even more influential positions, and to seize more power than they deserve. Just like we have seen over the last century, any excess of power only compounds, and eventually corrupt those who hold it. \\nWho\\u2019s Investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline? Meet the Banks Financing Attacks on Protesters \\u2013 Extended Commentary and Links Included Over time, the common people will typically adapt to their lower societal positions\\u2014becoming more and more comfortable and increasingly dependent upon the state to direct their lives. At the same time, the common people will become less and less self responsible. Eventually, the people become so dependent and the state becomes so domineering and power-drunk that the people will submit to any plan\\u2014no matter how foolish or ridiculous\\u2014simply so that they can avoid self-awareness and self-responsibility.

Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all \\u201c rigged \\u201d? \\nWhatever you think of The Donald, who in the world \\u2014 and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians ) \\u2014 could possibly forget him or the election he\\u2019s stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don\\u2019t make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He\\u2019s just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. \\nAdmittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind \\u201cpolitician,\\u201d even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France\\u2019s Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we\\u2019re not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it\\u2019s hard not to think that something \\u2014 and not just The Donald \\u2014 is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. \\nThe World War II Generation in 2016 \\nSometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and \\u2014 short of nuclear war \\u2014 is not likely to be again. \\nDespite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity\\u2019s greatest \\u2014 for want of a better word \\u2014 achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn\\u2019t live to experience, however, was history\\u2019s second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. \\nWhile nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war \\u2014 and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents\\u2019 amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn\\u2019t get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate \\u2014 each ready to change the subject on a moment\\u2019s notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else \\u2014 thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a \\u201choax\\u201d that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. \\nSo much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn\\u2019t have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system \\u2014 at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a \\u201cpopulist\\u201d by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his \\u201cbrand\\u201d of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be \\u201cinvested\\u201d in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven\\u2019t even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true \\u201ccampaign trail,\\u201d hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal \\u201c war chest .\\u201d \\nI would have to take a deep breath and explain to my parents that, in twenty-first-century America, by Supreme Court decree, money has become the equivalent of speech, even if it\\u2019s anything but \\u201cfree.\\u201d And let\\u2019s not forget that other financial lodestone for an American election these days: the television news, not to speak of the rest of the media. How could I begin to lay out for my parents, for whom presidential elections were limited fall events, the bizarre nature of an election season that starts with media speculation about the next-in-line just as the previous season is ending, and continues more or less nonstop thereafter? Or the spectacle of talking heads discussing just about nothing but that election 24/7 on cable television for something like a full year, or the billions of ad dollars that have fueled this never-ending Super Bowl of campaigns, filling the coffers of the owners of cable and network news? \\nWe\\u2019ve grown strangely used to it all, but my mom and dad would undoubtedly think they were in another country \\u2014 and that would be before they were even introduced to the American system as it now exists, the one for which Donald Trump is such a bizarre front man. \\nWhat Planet Is This Anyway? \\nI wish I still had my high school civics text. If you\\u2019re of a certain age, you\\u2019ll remember it: the one in which a man from Mars lands on Main Street, USA, to be lectured on the glories of American democracy and our carefully constructed, checked-and-balanced tripartite form of governance. I\\u2019m sure knowledge of that system changed life on Mars for the better, even if it was already something of a fantasy here on Earth in my parents\\u2019 time. After all, Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower \\u2014 my mom and dad voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson \\u2014 was the one who, in his farewell address in 1961, first brought \\u201cthe potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power\\u201d and \\u201cthe military-industrial complex\\u201d to the attention of the American people. \\nYes, all of that was already changing then, as a peacetime war state of unparalleled size developed in this country. Still, 30-odd years after my father\\u2019s death, surveying the American landscape, my parents might believe themselves on Mars. They would undoubtedly wonder what exactly had happened to the country they knew. After all, thanks to the Republican Party\\u2019s scorched-earth tactics in these last years in bipolar Washington, Congress, that collection of putative representatives of the people (now a crew of well-paid, well-financed representatives of the country\\u2019s special interests in a capital overrun with corporate lobbyists), hardly functions anymore. Little of significance makes it through the porticos of the Capitol. Recently, for instance, John McCain (usually considered a relatively \\u201cmoderate\\u201d Republican senator) suggested \\u2014 before walking his comments part way back \\u2014 that if Hillary Clinton were elected president, his fellow Republican senators might decide a priori not to confirm a single Supreme Court justice she nominated during her tenure in office. That, of course, would mean a court now down to what looks like a permanent crew of eight would shrink accordingly. And his comments, which once would have shocked Americans to the core, caused hardly a ripple of upset or protest. \\nOn my tour of this new world, I might start by pointing out to my mom and dad that the U.S. is now in a state of permanent war , its military at the moment involved in conflicts in at least six countries in the Greater Middle East and Africa. These are all purely presidential conflicts, as Congress no longer has a real role in American war-making (other than ponying up the money for it and beating the drums to support it). The executive branch stands alone when it comes to the war powers once checked and balanced in the Constitution. \\nAnd I wouldn\\u2019t want my parents to simply look abroad. The militarization of this country has proceeded apace and in ways that, I have not the slightest doubt, would shock them to their core. I could take my parents, for instance, to Grand Central Station in midtown Manhattan, their hometown and still mine, and on any day of the week they would see the once-inconceivable: actual armed soldiers on guard in full camo. I could mention that, at my local subway stop, I\\u2019ve several times noted a New York police department counterterror squad that could be mistaken for a military Special Ops team, assault rifles slung across their chests, and no one even stops and gawks anymore. I could point out that the police across the country increasingly have the look of military units and are supplied by the Pentagon with actual weaponry and equipment directly off distant U.S. battlefields, including armored vehicles of various sorts. I could mention that military surveillance drones, those precursors of future robotic warfare (and, for my parents, right out of the childhood sci-fi novels I used to read), are now regularly in American skies ; that advanced surveillance equipment developed in far-off war zones is now being used by the police here at home; and that, though political assassination was officially banned in the post-Watergate 1970s, the president now commands a formidable CIA drone force that regularly carries out such assassinations across large swaths of the planet, even against U.S. citizens , and without the say-so of anyone outside the White House, including the courts. I could mention that the president who, in my parents\\u2019 time, commanded one modest-sized secret army, the CIA\\u2019s paramilitaries, now essentially presides over a full-scale secret military, the Special Operations Command: 70,000 elite troops cocooned inside the larger U.S. military, including elite teams ready to be deployed on what are essentially executive missions across the planet. \\nI could point out that, in the twenty-first century, U.S. intelligence has set up a global surveillance state that would have shamed the totalitarian powers of the previous century and that American citizens, en masse, are included in it; that our emails (a new concept for my parents) have been collected by the millions and our phone records made available to the state; that privacy, in short, has essentially been declared un-American. I would also point out that, on the basis of one tragic day and what otherwise has been the most modest of threats to Americans, a single fear \\u2014 of Islamic terrorism \\u2014 has been the pretext for the building of the already existing national security state into an edifice of almost unbelievable proportions that has been given once unimaginable powers, funded in ways that should amaze anyone (not just visitors from the American past), and has become the unofficial fourth branch of the U.S. government without either discussion or a vote. \\nLittle that it does \\u2014 and it does a lot \\u2014 is open to public scrutiny. For their own \\u201csafety,\\u201d\\u201cthe People\\u201d are to know nothing of its workings (except what it wants them to know). Meanwhile, secrecy of a claustrophobic sort has spread across significant parts of the government. The government classified 92 million documents in 2011 and things seem not to have gotten much better since. In addition, the national security state has been elaborating a body of \\u201c secret law \\u201d\\u2014 including classified rules, regulations, and interpretations of already existing law \\u2014 kept from the public and, in some cases, even from congressional oversight committees. \\nAmericans, in other words, know ever less about what their government does in their name at home and abroad. \\nI might suggest to my parents that they simply imagine the Constitution of the United States being rewritten and amended in secrecy and on the fly in these years without as much as a nod to \\u201cWe, the People.\\u201d In this way, as our elections became elaborate spectacles, democracy was sucked dry and ditched in all but name \\u2014 and that name is undoubtedly Donald J. Trump. \\nConsider that, then, a brief version of how I might describe our new American world to my amazed parents. \\nAmerica as a National Security State \\nNone of this is The Donald\\u2019s responsibility. In the years in which a new American system was developing, he was firing people on TV. You could, of course, think of him as the poster boy for an America in which spectacle, celebrity, the gilded class of One Percenters, and the national security state have melded into a narcissistic, self-referential brew of remarkable toxicity. \\nWhether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president, one thing is obvious: the vast edifice that is the national security state, with its 17 intelligence agencies and enormous imperial military, will continue to elaborate itself and expand its power in our American world. Both candidates have sworn to pour yet more money into that military and the intelligence and Homeland Security apparatus that goes with it. None of this, of course, has much of anything to do with American democracy as it was once imagined. \\nSomeday perhaps, like my parents, \\u201cI\\u201d will be called back from the dead by one of my children to view with awe or horror whatever world exists. Long after the America of an unimaginable Donald J. Trump presidency or a far-more-imaginable Hillary Clinton version of the same has been folded into some god-awful, half-forgotten chapter in our history, I wonder what will surprise or confound \\u201cme\\u201d then. What version of our country and planet will \\u201cI\\u201d face in 2045? 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n          \"Comments \\nRepublicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles, but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their party\\u2019s platform of racism, hatred and economic inequality. To some Republican voters, it will even come as a surprise that Donald Trump loses next week\\u2019s election, but the signs were all there and here\\u2019s an excerpt from just one of the rare Fox News stories that admits it: \\u201c \\u2018Sleeping Giant\\u2019 awake and roaring \\u2013 early voting shows high Latino turnout \\u201c: \\nThe tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from Democratic-leaning Latino voters, potentially giving Clinton a significant advantage in Nevada and Colorado. With more than half the votes already cast in those states, Democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful 2012 pace, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. \\nLatinos, another group that Democrats have been banking on, are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated, and they very well may be the ones who give the party\\u2019s presidential nominee the margin of victory. \\u201cWe are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states, but Democrats are also making up ground,\\u201d said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert in voter turnout. \\nThey don\\u2019t let Sean Hannity or Lou Dobbs on to Fox News Latino, which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories, unlike Fox News or Fox Business, who just today had to retract an entirely false story about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \\nMeanwhile, Univision exit polling is showing that Latinos have the same high level of regard for Hillary Clinton in Florida that they have for President Barack Obama. This level of support is considered key to the Democratic nominee\\u2019s strategy to win the Sunshine State, which would act as a firewall, closing almost all of the Republican nominee\\u2019s paths to the presidency. The Miami Herald reports : \\nHillary Clinton has hit a key marker among Florida Hispanics, according to a new poll: She\\u2019s reached the level of popularity that helped President Barack Obama win the nation\\u2019s largest battleground state in 2012. \\nSixty percent of Florida Latinos favor Clinton, the Univision News poll shows. That\\u2019s the same number that voted for Obama four years ago, according to exit polls from that election. \\nThe polls further indicate that Hillary Clinton will probably get at least 60% of the latino vote in Florida, but there\\u2019s 9% of the sample that is still not decided, so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes. \\nPolitico is reporting that the Democratic nominee\\u2019s 30-point lead amongst Latino voters in Florida isn\\u2019t just a problem for Trump, but that for the entire GOP it\\u2019s a \\u201cterrifying\\u201d prospect. For the wing of the Republican party that likes to win elections, this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their party\\u2019s entire electoral history as the party of Lincoln flash before its eyes, which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted Grand Old Party is near. \\nRepublicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division, hatred and the 47% blew the 2012 election, which declared the GOP dead in the water. Particularly, the report cited the Tea Party\\u2019s radical anti-immigration policies, racist dog whistles and the war on women. \\nLuckily, that spurred the rank and file GOP voters in 2016 to pick an orange zombie Presidential candidate, a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch, and added muslims, finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the Democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted. \\nDonald Trump\\u2019s \\u201csafe zone\\u201d\\u2013 THE Fox News Network \\u2013 is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the Republican candidate so despises. \\nNow, there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next Tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead, and the Republican Party along with it. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"thread_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2939,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Now More Than Ever, We Must Tell the Truth About the Iraq War\",\n          \"Trump\\u2019s Prospects Improve\",\n          \"Latest Assault on Aleppo: West Covers Up Terror-Ties\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"spam_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.13030839940561106,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 201,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.168,\n          0.146,\n          0.863\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"replies_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 309,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          61,\n          18,\n          21\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"participants_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 240,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          43,\n          238,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"likes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 82,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 988,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          483,\n          0,\n          931\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          5,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"shares\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 82,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 988,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          483,\n          0,\n          931\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
