Nicknamed Tabby\\u2019s star, the celestial object features an odd dimming pattern. While some early potential explanations included comets, distortion, and space debris, none have provided a completely satisfactory solution. Astronomers Launch Search for Extraterrestrials in Potential 'Alien Megastructure' \\nThe more fanciful answer is that KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, an alien megastructure built by an advanced civilization to harness the sun\\u2019s energy. The Breakthrough Listen initiative, founded by Russian tycoon Yuri Milner, plans to spend over $100 million to investigate the star over the next ten years. \\n\\\"The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it\\u2019s the largest, most sensitive telescope that\\u2019s capable of looking at Tabby\\u2019s Star given its position in the sky,\\\" Breakthrough Listen co-director Andrew Siemion said in a statement, according to Space.com . \\n\\\"We\\u2019ve deployed a fantastic new SETI instrument that connects to that telescope, that can look at many gigahertz of bandwidth simultaneously and many, many billions of different radio channels all at the same time so we can explore the radio spectrum very, very quickly.\\\" \\nThe telescope\\u2019s observations began Wednesday night, and will continue for eight hours each night, for three nights over the next two-month period. \\nOther organizations have launched independent investigations into Tabby\\u2019s Star, including a Kickstarter campaign launched by the Yale astronomer Tabby Boyajian, who penned an initial study into the strange celestial object. Having raised over $100,000, that project plans to spend a year analyzing the star\\u2019s luminosity with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. NASA Earth-Like, Water-Rich Planets Could Be Common to Red Dwarfs \\nAs to whether new observations will uncover aliens, most scientists remain skeptical. \\\"I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s very likely \\u2013 a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that \\u2013 but nevertheless, we\\u2019re going to check it out,\\\" Dan Werthimer, chief scientists at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement. \\n\\\"But I think that ET, if it\\u2019s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It\\u2019ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident\\u2026that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, 'Hey, that\\u2019s a civilization.'\\\" \\nOf course, even if the Dyson sphere theory turns out to be true, that does not necessarily indicate life. Given the distance of the star, it will have taken 1,500 years for its light to reach Earth, meaning that we can only observe the star as it was 1,500 years ago. \\nThe civilization could be long gone. ...\",\n          \"AUSTRIA: Freedom Party leader calls Chancellor Angela Merkel the \\u201cmost dangerous woman in Europe\\u201d Heinz-Christian Strache (right), chairman of the anti-Islamization Freedom Party roasted the German Chancellor for allowing an unlimited amount of Muslim illegal aliens which he claims has left Europe on the verge of civil war. Talking to supporters, Strache argued \\u201cthe uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system\\u2026 makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.\\u201d Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party\\u2019s presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party\\u2019s presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, \\u201cwill be there for all Austrians\\u201d in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old\\u2019s recent election posters carry the phrase \\u201cso help me God\\u201d \\u2013 a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. \\u201cVienna must not become Istanbul\\u201d He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: \\u201cGod cannot be instrumentalised for one\\u2019s own intentions or for political purposes. \\u201cWe consider that mentioning God\\u2026 to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general.\\u201d The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came \\u201cdirectly from the heart\\u201d and \\u201cis strongly anchored in Christian and Western values\\u201d which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen\\u2019s left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered. The initial re-run of the election was due to take place in October but has been pushed back to December after defects were found in the postal vote envelopes.\",\n          \"1 / 2 \\nLe r\\u00eave s\\u2019av\\u00e9ra amer : il lui fallut vivre dans des pr\\u00e9fabriqu\\u00e9s de chantier, ce qui ne la dissuada pas. \\u00ab Je trouvais \\u00e7a marrant.

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.\\u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday.\",\n          \"Military Coup Attempt in Turkey ( 352 ) 0 10 0 0 A major reshuffle occurred to the police body in Turkey, where police chiefs in 61 Turkish provinces were either substituted or moved to other positions, local media reported, citing a government decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday. \\nMOSCOW (Sputnik) \\u2014 According to the Turkish Daily Sabah newspaper, 37 police chiefs were assigned for the first time to provincial police chief positions while 24 provincial police chiefs were reassigned to other provinces. \\nMeanwhile, two department heads in the General Directorate of Security were also reassigned to different positions and 34 provincial police chiefs were assigned to ministerial positions in Ankara, the daily added. \\nOn July 15, a military coup attempt took place in Turkey .

For some, it was a way to grow food that was healthy; for others, it was a way to be able to afford to eat good food. People wanted to grow their own food even though they lived in a city. \\nRegardless of why or how it started, urban gardening has grown to epic proportions and is now a movement committed to producing healthy, sustainable, locally-sourced food. \\nUrban farming is coming along, but it\\u2019s harder to keep animals in many urban areas. \\nIt\\u2019s not easy to grow food in a city, so people got creative. They went from growing a couple of plants in a pot or a window box to having a full garden in the middle of the city. \\nThere are several different methods of urban farming that range from a few plants and maybe a couple of chickens grown by one family to entire city lots grown and managed by co-ops of people with the same end goal. Indoor Gardening is great for somebody who has no porch, patio, yard, or roof where they can grow food. All plants are grown inside in containers or even small, indoor greenhouses. Some people are even lucky enough to have a solarium. Container Gardening works well for people who have small yards, porches, patios, decks, or balconies where they can grow food in containers. Window boxes, small raised beds, barrels, pots, and even kiddie pools serve as containers that plants can grow in. Community Gardening is becoming a big deal in a lot of areas. Neighbors or community members are coming together and planting edible plants in community places such as parks or other outdoor public areas. Some communities are now actually encouraging people to grow gardens on empty, abandoned lots because it makes the neighborhood look better and raises property values. Guerilla Gardening is actually one of the most interesting urban gardening methods that I\\u2019ve heard about. People subversively grow plants in public places or spaces that don\\u2019t belong to them such as vacant lots, road medians, or even strips of dirt beside sidewalks. Green roofs are a relatively new development, at least on a wide-scale basis. Roofs are designed specifically with a growing medium so that plants and trees can be grown to eat, clean the air, or make the area beautiful. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that urban gardening is a good thing. It brings people together and adds green space to concrete while providing locally sourced food and plants that help clean the air. \\nUrban gardens can also help mitigate soil erosion and the urban heat island effect. Finally, it teaches inner city kids the value of growing things and even provides green recreational and leisure space. \\nThe problem is that some people don\\u2019t see the benefit of it. That wouldn\\u2019t be so bad if those people weren\\u2019t complaining neighbors and members of local governments who want to put a stop to it. This was a huge issue when urban gardening was just something \\u201ctroublemaking hippies\\u201d were doing. \\nThankfully, it\\u2019s now becoming the vogue thing to do \\u2013 thanks in large part to popular restaurants and TV shows that promote locally-sourced foods and environmental sustainability. \\nBecause of the growing popularity and the improvements in property values due to turning a vacant lot into a garden, local governments are coming around. \\nHowever, for many of us, the struggle is still real because the problem still exists: you have no space to grow the garden that you dream of so that your family can eat healthfully and maybe even grow some of your own stockpile. \\nYou have plenty of options, though. You can grow a small garden indoors, or if you have a small yard you can do some raised beds. You can even grow a portable garden! \\nTalk to the Local Farmers \\nBut say you want to do more than grow a few plants in your house or yard \\u2013 what then? How do you get involved in the bigger scene? \\nWell, if you have a local farmers market, then that would be a great place to start. Go down and talk to some of them. \\nYou\\u2019ll be surprised how friendly most farmers are, and how willing they are to share information. Though cities can be huge, the farming community is probably relatively close-knit, so if you can\\u2019t find anybody who is directly involved in the local urban gardening projects, somebody can almost surely point you in the right direction. \\nStart Your Own Urban Farming Movement \\nHave you and the neighbors been talking about how nice it would be to start growing your own food? If so, you may have found some resources that you didn\\u2019t realize that you had. Hold a neighborhood meeting and see what others are willing to do. \\nIt could be that the big empty lot between you and your neighbor is actually owned by that guy so that he didn\\u2019t have somebody move in right next to him. If so, they may be open to making it useful, and you will have a place to start your garden. Organize it! \\nMost municipalities don\\u2019t care as much about urban gardening as they do about urban farming. Pepper plants and apple trees don\\u2019t seem to cause as many problems as goats and chickens do. \\nWhile laws often support (or at least don\\u2019t forbid) urban gardening, most cities do not support the presence of animals within the city limits. That\\u2019s a fight you can pick, if you want, at the local level. \\nPersonally, it may be better to talk to your neighbors to see how they feel about seeing or hearing chickens in your back yard. If you can work with them from the beginning, you may not have as many problems as you would have if you had bought some critters without speaking with them first. Even if they say no, at least you know they\\u2019re going to complain. \\nYou can also talk to some of the local co-ops about keeping animals on a farm outside the city or participating in a meat-share or produce-share with them. You have so many options; you just need to find them. \\nStart growing your own food even though you live in the city. With just 10 minutes a day, you\\u2019ll never have to worry about feeding your family again.

Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation\\u2019s work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton \\u201csold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.\\u201d\\u201cHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,\\u201d its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband\\u2019s character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen.

The problem arises when home prices fail to rise locally, and it balloons when home prices fall. We\\u2019ve seen that last time around. After bouncing along super low levels during Housing Bubble 1 through 2005, foreclosure filings skyrocketed during the housing crash starting in 2006. At first it was just an uptick that no one paid attention to. By 2008, it helped take down the financial system. \\nForeclosure filings peaked in late 2009, began dropping in 2010, and then tapered down to 2006 levels as foreclosures were processed, and as the home price surge of Housing Bubble 2 made new defaults less likely. But the spike in October stands out as much as those in the early phases of the housing bust in 2006 and 2007. Note the blue bar on the right : \\n\\nWhile some states are still trying to digest the foreclosures from the last housing crisis, according to Daren Blomquist, senior VP at ATTOM, \\u201cthe foreclosure activity increases in states such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia are more heavily tied to loans originated since 2009 \\u201d: \\n\\u201cThe loans used in this housing recovery that appear to be most susceptible to foreclosure are those such as FHA and VA with low down payments. Our data shows FHA and VA loans combined represent 49% of all active foreclosure inventory for loans originated in the seven years ending in 2015.\\u201d \\nThis chart shows the soaring proportion of FHA and VA mortgages issued since 2009 among the active foreclosure inventory. \\n\\nOn average across the nation, the foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 1,258 housing units. But in some states, the foreclosure rate was much worse. Here are the \\u201ctop\\u201d ten: Delaware: one in every 355 housing units New Jersey: one in every 564 housing units Maryland: one in every 679 housing units Illinois: one in every 704 housing units South Carolina: one in every 801 housing units Nevada: one in every 826 housing units Florida: one in every 895 housing Ohio: one in every 930 housing units Pennsylvania: one in every 1,018 housing units Georgia: one in every 1,028 housing units. \\nAnd here are the \\u201ctop\\u201d ten highest foreclosure rates among the 216 metropolitan areas with a population of over 200,000: York-Hanover, PA: one in every 274 housing units Atlantic City, NJ: one in every 301 housing units Rockford, IL: one in every 481 housing units Columbia, SC: one in every 498 housing units Trenton, NJ: one in every 499 housing units. Reading, PA: one in every 542 housing units Chicago, IL: one in every 571 housing units Dayton, OH: one in every 573 housing units Philadelphia, PA: one in every 597 housing units Salisbury, MD: one in every 625 housing units. \\nThese \\u201cforeclosure filings\\u201d are based on data that ATTOM gathered in 2,200 counties where over 90% of the US population lives. They include data on the three phases of foreclosure: Foreclosure starts: lender issues Notice of Default (NOD) and Lis Pendens (LIS) Auction notices for future public foreclosure auctions: Notice of Trustee\\u2019s Sale (NTS) and Notice of Foreclosure Sale (NFS); Real Estate Owned (REO) properties that have been foreclosed on and were repurchased by a bank at auction and are now held by the bank. \\nBroken down based on these three phases of the foreclosure process: \\nForeclosure starts jumped 25% in October from the prior month, to 43,352. While still down 11% year-over-year, it was the highest monthly increase in foreclosure starts since December 2008. \\nForeclosure starts increased even year-over-year in 23 states and Washington D.C. In some states they soared.

We are here to save ourselves, but in doing so, we save the world.\\u201d ~ Joseph Campbell \\nAs I write this, some shit is probably going down at Standing Rock . For anybody awake to the tyranny at hand, the events of the last few months have weighed heavily on our hearts. But the thing people need to remember is this: We\\u2019re all Native Americans. If you were born in the USA, and you love the land you were born on (which includes the entire fucking planet, by the way!), you are a Native American. You are a Native Earthling, for shit\\u2019s sake. It\\u2019s all connected. Their fight is our fight. Skin color is irrelevant. Where you were born or where you migrated to is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is this: are you for freedom, life, cooperation, and love; or are you for statism, profit, divisiveness, and violence? As Derrick Jensen said, \\u201cWe are the governors as well as the governed. This means that all of us who care about life need to force accountability onto those who do not.\\u201d \\nThe media (even the alternative media, mind you) is trying to spin this as a land issue, or a Native American issue. But it\\u2019s not. This is a freedom versus tyranny issue. This is an anarchy versus statism issue. This is a life versus entropy issue. All land is free. We just need to quit focusing on imaginary lines and think cooperation first, competition second. All human beings are free. We just need to quit being obsequious to state-driven authority and start asking (and answering) the tough questions. \\nThe only way to save the world is to save yourself. The only way to save the land from being poisoned is to save yourself from being poisoned (and from poisoning the land, yourself). The only way to save the environment from pollution is to save yourself from pollution (and from polluting the environment, yourself). In other words: The only way to save the Crashing Plane that is the Human Race is to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to put it on anybody else, and especially before attempting to right the plane. The oxygen mask, if you haven\\u2019t gathered already, is a metaphor for health, awareness, and truth. Save Yourself \\n\\u201cOnly the individual can rise to the heights of consciousness and awareness. The more you belong to the crowd, the deeper you fall into darkness.\\u201d ~ Osho \\nSaving yourself is putting on the oxygen mask of health, awareness, and truth. But what does that mean? It means questioning yourself to the nth degree , to the point of self-interrogation, and then questioning some more. It means psychosocial upheaval. It means getting uncomfortable. It means admitting you are wrong. In short: It means pain, existential pain of monumental proportions. \\nWhy is it so painful? Because much cognitive dissonance must be navigated. Everything that you\\u2019ve taken for granted as a fundamental truth must be turned inside out and given proper scrutiny. After such scrutiny, you will likely find that you were wrong about a great many things. But the only tool you need to weigh yourself against your deep questioning is the following anonymous quote: \\u201cWhen an honest man realizes that he is mistaken, he will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.\\u201d \\nThe question is: Do you have the courage to be honest with yourself? Because if you honestly choose the moral side of freedom, life, cooperation, and love, then you\\u2019re going to have to admit that statism provides none of these. It only sells the illusion of these. \\nStatism is about profit, ownership, divisiveness, and violence. It steals people\\u2019s freedom by enforcing, and profiting on, outdated and unjust laws (but only if the person believes in the law). It stifles life and human flourishing through calculative debt slavery and by convincing people into believing in an illusory debt. It creates physical divisiveness by drawing imaginary lines in the sand and declaring them \\u201cborders.\\u201d It creates psychological divisiveness through xenophobic nationalism and conditioned flag worship, setting up an us-versus-them mentality. When, really, the only us-versus-them mentality that holds any moral weight and intellectual validity is the freedom versus tyranny position. \\nStatism is tyrannical. There\\u2019s simply no way to wiggle out of this fact. It teaches authoritarianism and oppression. It teaches the individual to oppress and to tyrannize him/herself and others. It teaches people to blindly follow and obsequiously respect authority. It teaches extortion and violence. For if the authority of the state is not obeyed, or its many outdated and immoral laws are not followed, the individual is forced, violently if need be, to acquiesce. Comply or die, is what it comes down to. Either that or your freedom is taken away from you. \\nSo, when it comes down to it, saving yourself is, first and foremost, waking yourself up from the spell that statism has over you . And then it\\u2019s breaking that spell. Break that particular spell, and freedom is at hand. Break that particular spell, and ( your ) life begins. Break that particular spell, and you free yourself to learn how cooperation and love actually work, because you will finally begin taking responsibility for your own shit. No Masters. No rulers. That means taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions as a social creature on an interdependent planet. No more leaning on the crutch of authority. No more codependence on the state. Saving yourself is choosing freedom. Save the World \\n\\u201cThe modern hero, the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned, cannot, indeed must not, wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride, fear, rationalized avarice, and sanctified misunderstanding. \\u2018Live,\\u2019 Nietzsche says, \\u2018as though the day were here.\\u2019 It is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. And so, every one of us shares the supreme ordeal\\u2013\\u2013carries the cross of the redeemer\\u2013\\u2013not in the bright moments of his tribe\\u2019s great victories, but in the silences of his personal despair.\\u201d ~Joseph Campbell \\nSo, you\\u2019ve saved (freed) yourself from the grip of the state. What comes next? Freeing others, of course. But not so fast. Just because you\\u2019re free from the state, doesn\\u2019t mean the state isn\\u2019t still there, rearing its ugly head. It is still there, oppressing and extorting. It is still there, tyrannizing and destroying the planet under the guise of progress. It\\u2019s still there, trying to suck you back in. It is still Goliath and you are still David. And just because you recognize statism as tyranny and oppression, doesn\\u2019t mean that others do. Remember: most people are devoted statists who don\\u2019t even realize they are statists. Yes, the ignorance is that thick. But, I digress\\u2026 \\nYou\\u2019ve secured your \\u201coxygen mask\\u201d on the crashing plane that is the human race. Now it\\u2019s time to start helping others to secure their own masks. The problem here is: you can\\u2019t control other people. And, really, you don\\u2019t want to. You want people to be free, after all. That means you\\u2019re going to have to convince them . You\\u2019re going to have to be creative. You\\u2019re going to have to use your imagination and come up with novel ways to persuade them into being healthy. Yes, sadly it has come to that. The only way to bring health to those who are all-too-well-adjusted to a sick society, is to sell it. \\nThe real kick in the pants is: most people don\\u2019t want to hear what you have to say. People are wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance. People are caught up in their own state driven conditioning and brainwashing. Those cops \\u201cserving and protecting\\u201d the enforcement of the unhealthy, unsustainable, climate changing (game ender) North Dakota pipeline , are all wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance, conditioning, and brainwashing. They\\u2019re simply losing their own inner battle and coming up with the only thing they know: the cowardice and violence of a statist. \\nSo, it comes down to this: What do we (those who are already free and have their oxygen mask securely fastened) do against the cowardice and violence of the inured statist? We teach. We use our imagination to persuade them away from the unhealthiness of the state and toward the healthiness of freedom. We lead by example, influencing them with our courageous words and our actions. We coax them into freely putting their own oxygen mask on. For we know that volition is paramount if freedom is to be had. Force is the way of the state. Violence is the way of the state. A free human being helping others to be free must never use force or violence, lest they wish to be a tyrant. An authentically free human being wishes other human beings to be just as authentically free. \\nBut, and here\\u2019s the rub, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, \\u201cYour right to waive your fist ends one inch from my nose.\\u201d \\nThis means that when our health and freedom are under attack, we are morally justified to defend ourselves. And so, the most important thing we can do as free people, as individuals who have our oxygen masks securely fastened, is to stand our ground. To protect ourselves. Which, by extension, means protecting that which immediately sustains us: water, and the land that grows our food. The worst thing we can do is back down and play the pacifist. Like Derrick Jensen said, \\u201c Love does not imply pacifism.\\u201d The Goliath that is the state will trample all over pacifism. Indeed, the road to an unhealthy, unsustainable, immoral, and violent world is paved with pacifism. It\\u2019s paved with people turning a blind eye. It\\u2019s paved with the inaction of people who recognized evil and did fuckall with it. \\nAt the end of the day, Goliath (the state) is going to be Goliath. But Goliath is only Goliath because people believe in it. We dismantle goliath by convincing people not to give into Goliath\\u2019s unhealthy and unsustainable song and dance. First, we extract ourselves from being Goliath by transforming ourselves into courageous Davids. Then, we attempt to extract others from being Goliath. And if we cannot, we stand our ground and point out their cowardice and violence as unacceptable. We draw a line in the sand. We stand our ground. We protect our water. We declare, right in the face of the Goliath state, these courageous words by Thoreau : \\u201cI was not designed to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest.\\u201d Read more articles by Gary \\u2018Z\\u2019 McGee .
